      <h1>Diseases Caused by Malnutrition</h1>
      <p>Malnutrition, caused by an unbalanced diet or inadequate food intake, can lead to various diseases. These diseases affect the body’s function, impair growth and development, and can lead to long-term health problems.</p>

      <h2>Common Diseases Associated with Malnutrition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Marasmus:</strong> A severe form of malnutrition caused by a lack of sufficient calories, leading to extreme weight loss, muscle wasting, and stunted growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Kwashiorkor:</strong> A form of protein malnutrition, characterized by swelling, irritability, enlarged liver, and skin lesions.</li>
        <li><strong>Iron Deficiency Anemia:</strong> Caused by insufficient iron in the diet, leading to fatigue, weakness, and impaired immune function.</li>
        <li><strong>Rickets:</strong> A condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate, leading to weakened bones, bone pain, and skeletal deformities.</li>
        <li><strong>Scurvy:</strong> A disease caused by a lack of vitamin C, leading to swollen, bleeding gums, joint pain, and poor wound healing.</li>
        <li><strong>Beriberi:</strong> Caused by a lack of vitamin B1 (thiamine), leading to nerve damage, muscle weakness, and cardiovascular problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms of Malnutrition-related Diseases</h2>
      <p>Common symptoms of diseases caused by malnutrition include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and frequent infections. In severe cases, individuals may experience organ failure, developmental delays, and life-threatening complications.</p>

      <h2>How Malnutrition Affects the Body</h2>
      <p>When the body doesn’t get the right balance of nutrients, it becomes weaker and less capable of fighting off infections and diseases. Prolonged malnutrition can lead to irreversible damage to organs and growth defects, especially in children.</p>
